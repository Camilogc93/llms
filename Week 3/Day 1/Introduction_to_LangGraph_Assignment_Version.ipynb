        "LangGraph is a tool that leverages LangChain Expression Language to build coordinated multi-actor and stateful applications that includes cyclic behaviour.\n",

        "### Why Cycles?\n",

        "\n",
        "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effectively allowing us to recreate application flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why LangGraph?\n",
        "\n",
        "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

Research\\nexplores their use both as autonomous agents and as tools for software\\nengineering. LLM-integrated applications, on the other hand, are software\\nsystems that leverage an LLM to perform tasks that would otherwise be\\nimpossible or require significant coding effort. While LLM-integrated\\napplication engineering is emerging as new discipline, its terminology,\\nconcepts and methods need to be established. This study provides a taxonomy for\\nLLM-integrated applications, offering a framework for analyzing and describing\\nthese systems. It also demonstrates various ways to utilize LLMs in\\napplications, as well as options for implementing such integrations.\\n  Following established methods, we analyze a sample of recent LLM-integrated\\napplications to identify relevant dimensions. We evaluate the taxonomy by\\napplying it to additional cases. This review shows that applications integrate\\nLLMs in numerous ways for various purposes. Frequently, they comprise multiple\\nLLM integrations, which we term ``LLM components''. To gain a clear\\nunderstanding of an application's architecture, we examine each LLM component\\nseparately. We identify thirteen dimensions along which to characterize an LLM\\ncomponent, including the LLM skills leveraged, the format of the output, and\\nmore. LLM-integrated applications are described as combinations of their LLM\\ncomponents. We suggest a concise representation using feature vectors for\\nvisualization.\\n  The taxonomy is effective for describing LLM-integrated applications. It can\\ncontribute to theory building in the nascent field of LLM-integrated\\napplication engineering and aid in developing such systems. Researchers and\\npractitioners explore numerous creative ways to leverage LLMs in applications.\\nThough challenges persist, integrating LLMs may revolutionize the way software\\nsystems are built.\\n\\nPublished: 2023-11-09\\nTitle: Combating Misinformation in the Age of LLMs: Opportunities and Challenges\\nAuthors: Canyu Chen, Kai Shu\\nSummary: Misinformation such as fake news and rumors is a serious threat on\\ninformation ecosystems and public trust. The emergence of Large Language Models\\n(LLMs) has great potential to reshape the landscape of combating\\nmisinformation. Generally, LLMs can be a double-edged sword in the fight. On\\nthe one hand, LLMs bring promising opportunities for combating misinformation\\ndue to their profound world knowledge and strong reasoning abilities. Thus, one\\nemergent question is: how to utilize LLMs to combat misinformation? On the\\nother hand, the critical challenge is that LLMs can be easily leveraged to\\ngenerate deceptive misinformation at scale. Then, another important question\\nis: how to combat LLM-generated misinformation? In this paper, we first\\nsystematically review the history of combating misinformation before the advent\\nof LLMs. Then we illustrate the current efforts and present an outlook for\\nthese two fundamental questions respectively. The goal of this survey paper is\\nto facilitate the progress of utilizing LLMs for fighting misinformation and\\ncall for interdisciplinary efforts from different stakeholders for combating\\nLLM-generated misinformation.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-08-05\\nTitle: LLM economicus?

QLoRA backpropagates gradients through\\na frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank\\nAdapters~(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all\\nprevious openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the\\nperformance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a\\nsingle GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without\\nsacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is\\ninformation theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) double\\nquantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the\\nquantization constants, and (c) paged optimziers to manage memory spikes. We\\nuse QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of\\ninstruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets,\\nmultiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to\\nrun with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results\\nshow that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to\\nstate-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous\\nSoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human\\nand GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable\\nalternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot\\nbenchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of\\nchatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates where Guanaco fails compared to\\nChatGPT. We release all of our models and code, including CUDA kernels for\\n4-bit training.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-05-27\\nTitle: Accurate LoRA-Finetuning Quantization of LLMs via Information Retention\\nAuthors: Haotong Qin, Xudong Ma, Xingyu Zheng, Xiaoyang Li, Yang Zhang, Shouda Liu, Jie Luo, Xianglong Liu, Michele Magno\\nSummary: The LoRA-finetuning quantization of LLMs has been extensively studied to\\nobtain accurate yet compact LLMs for deployment on resource-constrained\\nhardware. However, existing methods cause the quantized LLM to severely degrade\\nand even fail to benefit from the finetuning of LoRA. This paper proposes a\\nnovel IR-QLoRA for pushing quantized LLMs with LoRA to be highly accurate\\nthrough information retention. The proposed IR-QLoRA mainly relies on two\\ntechnologies derived from the perspective of unified information: (1)\\nstatistics-based Information Calibration Quantization allows the quantized\\nparameters of LLM to retain original information accurately; (2)\\nfinetuning-based Information Elastic Connection makes LoRA utilizes elastic\\nrepresentation transformation with diverse information. Comprehensive\\nexperiments show that IR-QLoRA can significantly improve accuracy across LLaMA\\nand LLaMA2 families under 2-4 bit-widths, e.g., 4- bit LLaMA-7B achieves 1.4%\\nimprovement on MMLU compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The significant\\nperformance gain requires only a tiny 0.31% additional time consumption,\\nrevealing the satisfactory efficiency of our IR-QLoRA. We highlight that\\nIR-QLoRA enjoys excellent versatility, compatible with various frameworks\\n(e.g., NormalFloat and Integer quantization) and brings general accuracy gains.\\nThe code is available at https://github.com/htqin/ir-qlora.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-06-12\\nTitle: Exploring Fact Memorization and Style Imitation in LLMs Using QLoRA: An Experimental Study and Quality Assessment Methods\\nAuthors: Eugene Vyborov, Oleksiy Osypenko, Serge Sotnyk\\nSummary: There are various methods for adapting LLMs to different domains.

              "\"RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It is a technique used in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to improve the performance of language models by combining retrieval-based methods with generative models. Here's a brief overview of how it works:\\n\\n1. **Retrieval**: In the first step, the system retrieves relevant documents or pieces of information from a large corpus or database. This is typically done using a retrieval model, such as BM25 or a dense retrieval model like DPR (Dense Passage Retrieval).\\n\\n2. **Augmentation**: The retrieved documents are then used to augment the input to the generative model. This means that the generative model has access to additional context or information that can help it produce more accurate and relevant responses.\\n\\n3. **Generation**: Finally, the generative model, such as GPT-3 or BERT, uses the augmented input to generate a response. The additional context provided by the retrieved documents helps the model generate more informed and contextually appropriate responses.\\n\\nRAG is particularly useful in scenarios where the generative model alone might not have enough information to produce a high-quality response, such as in open-domain question answering, customer support, and other applications requiring access to a large knowledge base.\""

              "   'output': 'A Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system is a type of artificial intelligence model that combines retrieval-based and generation-based approaches to improve the quality and relevance of generated text. Here’s a breakdown of how it works:\\n\\n1. **Retrieval Component**: This part of the system retrieves relevant documents or pieces of information from a large corpus based on the input query. It uses techniques from information retrieval to find the most relevant content that can help answer the query or provide context.\\n\\n2. **Generation Component**: This part of the system generates text based on the input query and the retrieved documents. It uses techniques from natural language generation (NLG) to produce coherent and contextually appropriate responses.\\n\\n3. **Integration**: The retrieved documents are used to inform and guide the generation process. The generation model uses the information from the retrieved documents to produce more accurate and contextually relevant responses.\\n\\n### Key Benefits of RAG Systems:\\n- **Improved Accuracy**: By leveraging relevant documents, the system can provide more accurate and factually correct responses.\\n- **Contextual Relevance**: The generated text is more likely to be contextually appropriate because it is based on relevant information.\\n- **Scalability**: RAG systems can handle a wide range of queries by retrieving information from a large corpus, making them versatile and scalable.\\n\\n### Applications:\\n- **Question Answering**: Providing accurate answers to user queries by retrieving relevant documents and generating responses based on them.\\n- **Customer Support**: Assisting customer service agents by retrieving relevant information and generating helpful responses.\\n- **Content Creation**: Aiding in the creation of articles, reports, and other content by providing relevant information and generating text.\\n\\nOverall, RAG systems represent a powerful approach to combining the strengths of retrieval-based and generation-based models to enhance the quality and relevance of AI-generated text.',\n",

It achieves up to 10 times less communication while maintaining performance comparable to dense LoRA. This method also offers benefits in terms of heterogeneity and privacy.\\n\\n2. **Cost-Effective and Flexible Implementation**:\\n   - **Open LoRa for IoT**: This design and implementation allow users to conveniently build private LoRa networks for various IoT applications. The improved software architecture of the LoRa network server, which is open-source, ensures scalability and flexibility. The server is divided into four decoupled modules and uses a messaging system based on streaming data for interaction between modules.\\n\\n3. **Energy Efficiency and Large-Scale Deployment**:\\n   - **LoRa Networking for IoT**: LoRa networks meet the key requirements of IoT applications, such as low cost, large-scale deployment, and high energy efficiency. This makes it suitable for applications like smart cities and precision agriculture. The open standard of LoRa allows for the development of autonomous LPWAN networks without third-party infrastructure.\\n\\nThese improvements highlight the importance of considering system-specific constraints and provide a competitive baseline for future work in federated finetuning and IoT network implementations.',\n",
